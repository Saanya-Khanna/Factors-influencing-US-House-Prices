# Factors-influencing-US-House-Prices

# Description:
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. housing market using SQL inner joins. Leveraging the "US_House_Price" table, this endeavor explores the integration of related data from auxiliary tables, such as "Location" and "Economic_Indicators," to derive valuable insights into housing trends, economic indicators, and geographical aspects. The inner join technique is employed to seamlessly combine data based on shared identifiers, offering a holistic view of the U.S. housing landscape.

# Data Source:
The U.S. housing market data employed in this project is taken from Factors influencing U.S. house Prices sources that provide up-to-date information on housing prices, economic indicators, and regional demographics. The dataset has been meticulously organized, encompassing tables such as "US_House_Price," "Location," and "Economic_Indicators" to facilitate a holistic analysis.

# Skills Used:
- Inner Joins
- SQL Querying
- Data Analysis
- Database Management

# Usage:
The SQL queries provided in this project are designed to be executed in a SQL environment connected to a database containing U.S. housing market data. Each query focuses on a specific aspect of analysis, showcasing the power of inner joins in extracting meaningful information from interconnected datasets. Users can run these queries individually or collectively to gain a nuanced understanding of the U.S. housing market.

# Instructions:
1. Ensure access to the U.S. housing market database, including the "US_House_Price," "Location," and "Economic_Indicators" tables.
2. Copy and execute the desired SQL queries in a SQL environment connected to the relevant database.
3. Review the query results to explore insights derived from the integrated data.
