# Factors Influencing US House Prices

# Description:
Embark on a comprehensive exploration of the U.S. housing market, unraveling key insights through the fusion of SQL inner joins and Python visualization techniques. This project delves into critical factors such as DATE, building_permits, const_price_index, delinquency_rate, GDP, house_for_sale_or_sold, housing_subsidies, income, interest_rate, and mortgage_rate. The goal is to gain a nuanced understanding of their collective impact on U.S. house prices, employing both SQL and Python to extract valuable insights from interconnected datasets.

# Data Source:
The U.S. housing market data originates from [Factors influencing U.S. house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jyotsnagurjar/factors-influencing-us-house-prices), providing up-to-date information on factors influencing house prices. The dataset encompasses fields such as DATE, building_permits, const_price_index, delinquency_rate, GDP, house_for_sale_or_sold, housing_subsidies, income, interest_rate, and mortgage_rate.

# Skills Used:
- Inner Joins
- SQL Querying
- Data Analysis
- Database Management
- Python (Data Visualization)

# Usage:
- Execute the SQL queries provided in this project within a SQL environment connected to a database housing U.S. housing market data. Driven by inner joins, these queries enable a seamless exploration of the interconnected dataset. 
- Python scripts, including the provided code, transform raw data into visually compelling representations, facilitating a deeper understanding of U.S. housing market trends.

# Python Code:
The Python code leverages pandas and matplotlib to visualize average house prices over the years. It reads data from the CSV file, converts the 'DATE' column to datetime format, extracts year and month information, and calculates mean prices grouped by year. The resulting trend visualization offers a clear depiction of average house price dynamics.
